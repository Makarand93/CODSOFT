# 📊 Student Grade Calculator – CODSOFT Internship (Task 2)

## 👨‍💻 Project Information
- **Project Title:** Student Grade Calculator
- **Internship:** Java Development Internship
- **Organization:** CODSOFT
- **Language Used:** Java
- **Type:** Console-Based Application

---

## 📖 Project Description

The Student Grade Calculator is a Java console-based application that calculates a student's academic performance based on marks obtained in multiple subjects.

The program:
- Accepts marks for each subject
- Calculates total marks
- Computes average percentage
- Assigns a grade based on performance
- Displays the final result clearly

This project demonstrates the use of core Java programming concepts and logical problem solving.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts number of subjects
- Takes marks input for each subject
- Calculates total marks
- Calculates average percentage
- Assigns grade using conditional logic
- Displays structured output
- Simple and user-friendly console interface

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used

- Scanner Class (for user input)
- For Loop (to input marks)
- Conditional Statements (if-else ladder)
- Arithmetic Operations
- Basic Input Validation
- Console Output Formatting

---

## 🧠 Grade Calculation Logic

Grades are assigned based on the average percentage.

### Example Grading System:

| Percentage | Grade |
|------------|--------|
| 90 and above | A |
| 75 – 89 | B |
| 60 – 74 | C |
| 40 – 59 | D |
| Below 40 | Fail |

## 📝 Algorithm

1. Start the program  
2. Read number of subjects  
3. Initialize total marks to 0  
4. Accept marks for each subject using a loop  
5. Add marks to total  
6. Calculate average percentage  
7. Assign grade using conditional statements  
8. Display total, average, and grade  
9. End program

## ▶ How to Run the Program

### Step 1 – Compile
```bash
javac Task2_StudentGradeCalculator.java
```

### Step 2 – Run
```bash
java Task2_StudentGradeCalculator
```

## 📌 Sample Output

```
Enter number of subjects: 3
Enter marks for subject 1: 80
Enter marks for subject 2: 75
Enter marks for subject 3: 90

Total Marks: 245
Average Percentage: 81.67%
Grade: B
```
