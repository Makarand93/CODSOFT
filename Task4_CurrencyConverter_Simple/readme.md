# 💱 Currency Converter – CODSOFT Internship (Task 4)

## 👨‍💻 Project Information
- **Project Title:** Currency Converter
- **Internship:** Java Development Internship
- **Organization:** CODSOFT
- **Language Used:** Java
- **Type:** Console-Based Application

---

## 📖 Project Description

The Currency Converter is a Java console-based application that converts an amount from one currency to another using predefined exchange rates.

The program:
- Allows the user to select base currency
- Allows the user to select target currency
- Accepts amount to convert
- Performs currency conversion
- Displays the converted amount clearly

This project demonstrates the use of conditional logic and arithmetic calculations in Java.

## 🚀 Features

- Menu-based currency selection
- User input for amount
- Predefined exchange rates
- Currency conversion calculation
- Clear and structured output
- Simple and easy-to-use console interface

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used

- Scanner Class (for user input)
- Conditional Statements (if-else / switch)
- Arithmetic Operations
- Menu-driven Program Design
- Console Output Formatting

---

## 🧠 Currency Conversion Logic

The conversion is calculated using the formula:

```
Converted Amount = Amount × Exchange Rate
```

### Example:

If:
- 1 USD = 83 INR  
- User enters 10 USD  

Then:
```
10 × 83 = 830 INR
```

## 📝 Algorithm

1. Start the program  
2. Display currency options  
3. Take base currency choice  
4. Take target currency choice  
5. Input amount  
6. Apply exchange rate formula  
7. Display converted amount  
8. End program

## ▶ How to Run the Program

### Step 1 – Compile
```bash
javac Task4_CurrencyConverter.java
```

### Step 2 – Run
```bash
java Task4_CurrencyConverter
```

## 📌 Sample Output

```
Select Base Currency:
1. USD
2. INR
3. EUR

Select Target Currency:
1. USD
2. INR
3. EUR

Enter Amount: 100

Converted Amount: 8300 INR
```
